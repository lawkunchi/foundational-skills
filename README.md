### Task 1: Advanced Stylish Button

- Background color: `#4CAF50`
- Text color: `White`
- Padding: `15px 32px`
- Font size: `16px`
- On hover, the button exhibits a shadow effect that increases in size from `0` to `5px`, and transitions the background color to `#45a049` over `0.3` seconds.
- On focus, the button displays a custom color.

### Task 2: Interactive Content Toggle

This feature allows for the hiding and showing of div list items one at a time upon clicking the toggle button. Additionally, it displays the count of the elements in the format of `current/total elements`.
